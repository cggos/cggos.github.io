# Companies

## Waymo

[Waymo](https://waymo.com/) began as the Google self-driving car project in 2009. Today, we're an independent self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for everyone to get around—without the need for anyone in the driver’s seat.

## Mobileye

[Mobileye](https://www.mobileye.com/) is the leading supplier of software that enables Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS), with more than 25 automaker partners including some of the world’s largest. Beyond ADAS, our technology has rapidly evolved to also support the three pillars of Autonomous Driving – Sensing, Mapping, and Driving Policy.

## Wayve

[Wayve](https://wayve.ai) is pioneering artificial intelligence software for self-driving cars.
